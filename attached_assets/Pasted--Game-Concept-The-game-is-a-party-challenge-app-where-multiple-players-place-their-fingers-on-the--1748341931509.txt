🎮 Game Concept
The game is a party challenge app where multiple players place their fingers on the screen. After a suspenseful moment, all but one button disappears — the remaining player is the one who must complete a dare. It's a social, real-time elimination mechanic with tension and surprise.

🧠 Game UI Breakdown
🖐️ Initial Interaction Phase
Multi-Touch Buttons:

Multiple circular buttons (roughly 5–10) are shown on screen, evenly distributed across a central area.

Each button is identical in size and style — likely intended for players to each place a finger on one.

Button Design:

Circular with a subtle glow or color shift when pressed.

Button highlights or animates slightly when touched (e.g., soft pulsing glow).

Prompt Text:

A message near the top like "Everyone put your finger on a circle" or "Hold until one remains..."

Stylized, playful font, centered at the top.

⏳ Countdown or Elimination Phase
After all players have placed their fingers:

A short suspenseful delay (possibly with a sound effect or countdown visual).

Then, all buttons suddenly disappear — except one.

😱 Selection Reveal
The last remaining circle indicates who has been chosen to do the dare.

This button may:

Flash

Play a sound effect (e.g. buzzer, drumroll)

Enlarge or animate briefly

A text like "You have been chosen!" or "Do the dare!" appears prominently on screen.

🎲 Dare Screen (Possible)
After selection, the app likely shows:

A randomly generated dare or challenge

Button to "Accept" or "Pass" (with consequences?)

Possibly a dare customization or category setting in a separate menu

🎨 Visual Style
Color Theme: Bright, vibrant, party-themed palette (neon purples, reds, blues).

Fonts: Bold, rounded, and playful — suitable for a party atmosphere.

Animations: Smooth transitions, button pulsing, disappearing effects with flair.

📱 UX Details
Touch Handling:

The game clearly supports multi-touch.

Only activates once all circles are touched (or after a timer).

Fairness Mechanic:

Likely includes some randomization logic or timeout to prevent predictability.
